But instead of illustrating this point here by introducing loads of material not covered in the text book, we will limit our ambitionsto simply emphasizing the obvious: the similarities between logical truth values and Python’s boolean type and its operations.  \n\nIn Python terms, a logical statement is an *expression* of boolean type, such as $3 < 7$. Variables can be used in such expressions, although it should be noted that every variable will stand for some concrete value at run-time. \n\nOf the logical connectives, Python directly supports *conjunction* and *disjunction* in terms of the built-in primitives **`and`** and **`or`**, as well as *negation* via the primitive **`not`** (for more details, see the section \"Booleans - AND, OR\" in the note *Introduction to Python Programming*).  \n\nA nested loop can be constructed to generate the truth table for standard logic operators such as the `and`:","metadata":{},"id":"ad5ba858-ddd3-479a-b163-de35abddc75b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"for p in (True, False):\n    for q in (True, False):\n        print(\"%10s %10s %10s\" %(p, q, (p and q)))","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":48,"lastExecutedAt":1728233275731,"lastExecutedByKernel":"bc8fd8af-a1a5-4974-85b8-8e38d18cf5d2","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"for p in (True, False):\n    for q in (True, False):\n        print(\"%10s %10s %10s\" %(p, q, (p and q)))","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":101,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"335035c9-dcc5-4764-b965-0d720819066b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"      True       True       True\n      True      False      False\n     False       True      False\n     False      False      False\n"}]},{"source":"But, we can leverage `itertools.product` to generate all combinations of $p$ and $q$ in one go, and then use map or list comprehensions to handle the logic more succinctly.","metadata":{},"id":"cb7e19ed-38bc-43b4-ac94-59d16d74ca4d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from itertools import product\n\n# Generate all combinations of p and q using product\ncombinations2 = product([True, False], repeat=2)\n\n# Print the results in a formatted way\nfor p, q in combinations2:\n    print(f\"{str(p):>10} {str(q):>10} {str(p and q):>10}\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":54,"lastExecutedAt":1728233275785,"lastExecutedByKernel":"bc8fd8af-a1a5-4974-85b8-8e38d18cf5d2","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"from itertools import product\n\n# Generate all combinations of p and q using product\ncombinations2 = product([True, False], repeat=2)\n\n# Print the results in a formatted way\nfor p, q in combinations2:\n    print(f\"{str(p):>10} {str(q):>10} {str(p and q):>10}\")","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":101,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"f01cf7ce-1ef6-4d00-9de3-4254b48337af","cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"      True       True       True\n      True      False      False\n     False       True      False\n     False      False      False\n"}]},{"source":"To get more intuition, let's consider the code segment that generates the truth table for the expression $\\neg p \\wedge (q\\vee r)$","metadata":{},"id":"fbff3279-4ee2-4011-836d-466281758729","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"combinations3 = product([True, False], repeat=3)\nfor p, q, r in combinations3:\n    print(f\"{str(p):>10} {str(q):>10} {str(r):>10}\\\n                         {str(not p and (q or r)):>10}\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":55,"lastExecutedAt":1728233275840,"lastExecutedByKernel":"bc8fd8af-a1a5-4974-85b8-8e38d18cf5d2","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"combinations3 = product([True, False], repeat=3)\nfor p, q, r in combinations3:\n    print(f\"{str(p):>10} {str(q):>10} {str(r):>10}\\\n                         {str(not p and (q or r)):>10}\")","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":353,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"f26078a3-2027-4f5b-8a50-857285242875","cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"      True       True       True                              False\n      True       True      False                              False\n      True      False       True                              False\n      True      False      False                              False\n     False       True       True                               True\n     False       True      False                               True\n     False      False       True                               True\n     False      False      False                              False\n"}]},{"source":"Other connectives can easily be encoded as functions by use of the **`if`** statement.

[\href{https://twitter.com/brilliantorg/status/1175031964727959558}{The Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg }]. 
    K\"{o}nigsberg is the name for the historic Prussian city that is now Kaliningrad, Russia.
    The town had a river with two islands. The islands were connected to the river banks by seven bridges 
    (see below).
     There was an 
entertaining or interesting exercise for the citizens 
of Konigsberg. \Blue{ Start from any land regions and 
come back to the starting point after crossing each 
of the seven bridges exactly once without repeating 
same path. Is it possible?}
       The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler solved this problem~\footnote{
  \href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/leonard-eulers-solution-to-the-konigsberg-bridge-problem}{Leonard Euler's Solution to the Konigsberg Bridge Problem}}
       in 1736. Can you solve it?

    \item Start at any vertex if finding an Euler circuit. If finding an Euler path, start at one of the two vertices with odd degree.
    \item Choose any edge leaving your current vertex, provided deleting that edge will not separate the graph 
      into two disconnected sets of edges.
   \item Add that edge to your circuit, and delete it from the graph.

{\small 
{\bf Example 3.7.} In the graph below, vertices represent land masses and edges represent bridges. 
If you are allowed to add multiple edges (which would indicate going over a bridge twice), 
what edges should you add so that the graph has an Euler circuit?
}

      \pause
      
 {\small  Adding an edge from land mass $B$ to $A$, and adding an edge from land mass $D$ to $E$
   results in a connected graph with all even vertices. Thus, the graph resulting from adding these edges will have 
   an Euler circuit. So we could start at land mass $A$ and travel over every bridge exactly once
    (except for the bridge between $A$ and $B$ and the bridge between $D$ and $E$
     which we would travel over twice) and end at land mass $A$.
}

\begin{frame}[plain]{}

\underline{\bf Eulerization}
\medskip

\Blue{Eulerization} is the process of adding edges to a graph to create an Euler circuit on a graph. 
To eulerize a graph, edges are \Purple{duplicated} to connect pairs of vertices with odd degree. 
Connecting two odd degree vertices increases the degree of each, giving them both even degree. 
When two odd degree vertices are not directly connected, we can duplicate all edges in a path connecting the two.
\medskip

{\bf Remark.} Note that we can only \Purple{duplicate} edges, \Red{not create} edges where there wasn't one before. 
\Purple{Duplicating edges} would mean walking or driving down a road twice 
while \Red{creating an edge} where there wasn't
 one before is akin to installing a new road!
 \vspace{.5in}
 
 \end{frame}
 
 \begin{frame}[plain]{}
 
 {\bf Example 3.8.} For the rectangular graph shown, three possible eulerizations are shown. 
 Notice, in each of these cases, the vertices that started with odd degrees have even degrees after eulerization, 
 allowing for an Euler circuit.

 \begin{center}
         \includegraphics[height=1.2cm]{lecture3-fig11.png}  
        \includegraphics[height=1.2cm]{lecture3-fig10.png}  
          \includegraphics[height=1.2cm]{lecture3-fig12.png}  
            \includegraphics[height=1.2cm]{lecture3-fig13.png}  
      \end{center} 
      \pause
      
  In the example above, youâll notice that the last eulerization required duplicating seven edges, 
  while the first two only required duplicating five edges. 
  If we were eulerizing the graph to find a walking path, we would want the eulerization with minimal duplications. \pause 
  \medskip
  
  The problem of finding the optimal eulerization is called the \Blue{Chinese Postman Problem}, 
a name given by an American in honor of the Chinese mathematician Mei-Ko Kwan who first studied the problem in 1962 
while trying to find optimal delivery routes for postal carriers. 
This problem is important in determining efficient routes for garbage trucks, school buses, parking meter checkers, street sweepers, and more.
